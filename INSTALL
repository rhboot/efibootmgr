Running 'make' builds the file src/efibootmgr.
efibootmgr should be placed into /usr/sbin/.

efibootmgr currently requires efivar version 0.19, as well as the pkg-config
utility, to be built. If you receive a message like the following...

  src/include/efi.h:32:20: fatal error: efivar.h: No such file or directory

then you have not installed these dependencies, which can be found at:

* efivar: https://github.com/rhboot/efivar

* pkg-config: https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org
